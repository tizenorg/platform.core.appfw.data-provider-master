/*!
 * \note
 * An instance has three states.
 * ACTIVATED, DEACTIVATED, DESTROYED
 *
 * When the master is launched and someone requiers to create this instance,
 * The master just allocate a heap for new instance.
 * We defined this as "DEACTIVATED" state.
 *
 * After master successfully allocate heap for an instance,
 * It will send a load request to a specified slave
 * (The slave will be specified when a package informaion is
 * prepared via configuration file of each livebox packages.)
 * We defined this as "REQUEST_TO_ACTIVATE" state.
 *
 * After the slave create a new instance, it will sends back
 * "created" event to the master.
 * Then the master will change the state of the instance to
 * "ACTIVATED".
 *
 * Sometimes, slaves can meet some unexpected problems then
 * it will tries to clear all problems and tries to keep them in safe env.
 * To do this, master or slave can be terminated.
 * In this case, the master has to find the fault module(crashed livebox)
 * and prevent it from loading at the slave.
 * And it will send requests for re-creating all other normal liveboxes.
 * We defined this as "REQUEST_TO_REACTIVATE".
 *
 * After slave is launched again(recovered from fault situation), it will
 * receives "re-create" event from the master, then it will create all
 * instances of requested liveboxes.
 *
 * When the master receives "created" event from the slaves,
 * It will change the instance's state to "ACTIVATED"
 * But now, the master will not send "created" event to the clients.
 *
 * Because the clients don't want to know the re-created liveboxes.
 * They just want to know about fault liveboxes to display deactivated
 * message.
 *
 * Sometimes the master can send requests to the slave to unload instances.
 * We defined this as "REQUEST_TO_DEACTIVATE".
 *
 * After the slave successfully destroy instances,
 * The master will change the instance's state to "DEACTIVATED"
 * It is same state with the first time when it is created in the master.
 *
 * Sometimes, the instances can be deleted permanently from the master and slave.
 * We called this "destorying an instance".
 * So we defined its states as "DESTROYED".
 * It can make confusing us, the "DESTROYED" means like the instance is already deleted from the
 * heap,. 
 * Yes, it is right. But the instance cannot be deleted directly.
 * Because some callbacks still reference it to complete its job.
 * So the instance needs to keep this DESTROYED state for a while
 * until all callbacks are done for their remained jobs.
 *
 * To unload the instance from the slave,
 * The master should send a request to the slave,
 * And the master should keep the instance until it receives "deleted" event from the slave.
 * We defined this state as "REQUEST_TO_DESTROY".
 * 
 * After master receives "deleted" event from the slave,
 * It will change the state of an master to "DESTROYED"
 *
 * There is one more event to change the state of an instance to "DESTROYED".
 * In case of system created livebox, it could be destroyed itself.
 * So the slave will send "deleted" event to the master directly.
 * Even if the master doesn't requests to delete it.
 *
 * In this case, the master will change the state of an instance to
 * "DESTROYED" state. but it will wait to delete it from the heap until
 * reference count of an instance reaches to ZERO.
